# Misewe - An (Experimental-AI-Built) Minimal Secure Web Server

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: This is an experimental project built entirely with AI assistance. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!**

This project is a proof-of-concept web server written in C, developed through collaboration with AI (specifically, Cursor AI). It serves as an interesting experiment in AI-assisted development and demonstrates both the capabilities and limitations of current AI coding assistants.

## Project Context

- ü§ñ **AI-Driven Development**: Every line of code, from architecture to implementation, was written with AI guidance
- üß™ **Experimental Nature**: While functional, this is a learning experiment, not production software
- üî¨ **Research Value**: Demonstrates AI's current capabilities in system programming
- üìö **Educational Purpose**: Useful for studying AI-human collaboration in software development

## Features Implemented with AI

- Basic HTTP server functionality
- Security features (experimental)
- Rate limiting implementation
- File serving capabilities
- Test suite

## Development Process

This project was developed entirely through interaction with AI, following this process:
1. Initial architecture design through AI consultation
2. Iterative implementation with AI guidance
3. Bug fixing and improvements based on AI suggestions
4. Test suite development with AI assistance

## Running the Project

For experimental or educational purposes only:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/erson/misewe.git
cd misewe
make

# Start server (for testing only)
./bin/misewe

# Run test suite
./test/run_tests.sh
```

## Project Structure

```
misewe/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/          # Source code (AI-generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/         # Test suite (AI-designed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ www/          # Web root directory

## Known Limitations

As an AI-developed project, there are inherent limitations:
- Security measures may not be comprehensive
- Edge cases might not be fully handled
- Performance optimizations may be basic
- Code structure reflects AI's current capabilities

## Educational Value

This project is valuable for:
- Studying AI-assisted development
- Learning about web server implementation
- Understanding security considerations
- Exploring test-driven development

## Development Notes

### AI Collaboration Process
- All code was written through interaction with Cursor AI
- Decisions were guided by AI suggestions
- Testing and validation were AI-assisted
- Documentation was AI-generated

### Technical Stack
- Language: C
- Build System: Make
- Testing: Shell scripts
- Platform: POSIX-compliant systems

## Contributing

While this is primarily an AI experiment, you can:
1. Study the AI-human collaboration process
2. Experiment with the codebase
3. Report findings about AI-generated code
4. Suggest improvements for future AI experiments
