# Contributing to Zircon

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Zircon project! As this is primarily an AI experiment, the contribution process is somewhat different from traditional open-source projects.

## Types of Contributions

There are several ways you can contribute to this project:

1. **Study and Report**: Analyze the code, identify patterns, and report findings about the nature of AI-generated code.

2. **Suggestions**: Propose improvements for future iterations of the AI-human collaboration.

3. **Bug Reports**: Identify issues with the existing implementation that might not have been caught during development.

4. **Documentation**: Improve the documentation to make it more accessible and educational.

## Guidelines

When contributing, please keep in mind:

1. **Educational Focus**: This project is primarily meant for educational purposes, demonstrating AI capabilities in system-level programming.

2. **Minimalism**: Zircon is a minimal web server by design. Contributions should respect this philosophy.

3. **Documentation**: All contributions should include proper documentation explaining the changes and the reasoning behind them.

4. **Testing**: Include tests for your changes using the existing test protocol when possible.

## Process

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Make your changes in a new branch with a descriptive name.

3. Run the test protocol to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

4. Create a pull request with a clear description of:
   - What changes were made
   - Why these changes are beneficial
   - How they were tested

5. Wait for review and feedback.

## Code Style

Please follow the existing code style in the project:

- Use 4-space indentation
- Follow the C99 standard
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Comment complex logic and function purposes
- Use descriptive variable and function names

## Questions

If you have any questions about contributing, please open an issue in the repository.
